### Getting Started / Installation
_Clone this repo_
```
git clone https://github.com/ooade/next-react-toolbox.git

cd next-react-toolbox
```

_Install Dependencies_
```
yarn
```
or
```
npm install
```

### Usage
#### How it works
Webpack handles the loading of css and styles to the page. With ExtractTextPlugin, we were able to place each css file in the designated directory (css); In development, we place just a file (style.css) unminified while in production, we split them up by page name (for each page, a css file is generated at build time).

We use webpack-assets-manifest plugin to keep track of only our css files thereby creating a css-manifest.json file.

Thanks to the power of css-modules-require-hook, we were able to make our css files recognizable by our server with a matching `localIdentName` as used in our css-loader.

Our CSS files are injected to the page by the library we created `lib/StyleSheet` which takes a `pathname`.

#### Run it
It's simple.
```
yarn run dev
```
or
```
npm run dev
```
P.S: You can change/add to React-ToolBox variables in the postcss.config.js file, even after running the app, it works! :smile:

#### Usage in a non-nextjs App
> How to follow this repo pattern in a non-nextjs environment.
It's easy, just make sure you have this on your server:
```js
const cssModulesHook = require('css-modules-require-hook');

cssModulesHook({
  generateScopedName: '[local]__[hash:base64:3]'
});
```
And wherever you have the SSR logic, include the `StyleSheet` library. <br/>
P.S: You will have to strip off the ".next" paths and also replace `bundles/pages${path}.js.css` to wherever the stylesheet(s) are being generated to.

### Deployment
